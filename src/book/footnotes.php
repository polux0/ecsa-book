            <sup>1</sup>Information has emerged dialectically as the most general form for the products of
            capitalism defined as having both use-value and exchange value. Because of its abstract character, it is
            often forgotten that information must have a material substrate, be it the standard commodity or an array of
            atoms on a computer chip. For the briefest of sketches, consider that the commodity was always composed of
            readable material differences, differences in matter created through labor. As a wager to get from M to M′,
            the commodity’s market legibility as a significant state of informed matter (a ‘hieroglyph’) has become
            increasingly computational. For my take on the networked commodity and the intimate connections between
            computing and capital see Beller (2017 and 2021). In each text I develop the argument that the general
            formula for capital can be rewritten M–I–M′, where M is money and I is information: Information replaces the
            commodity ‘C’ in Marx’s classic formulation M–C–M′.

            competition over prices in a market. Indeed, history shows that the great monopolies/oligopolies of history
            are defeated by being technologically superseded, not by competition from lower cost providers. We do not

            <sup>73</sup>This is the first use of the term ‘commodity,’ which appears frequently in the
            following analysis. We define ‘commodities’ to include all outputs produced for, and recognized by, the
            network. It is not Marx’s use of the term, which associates commodities with capitalist production
            relations. There, commodity production has two dimensions: it is extractive, in the sense that commodities
            are produced by the workers and owned by the capitalist, and it is produced so as to be sold for a profit.
            This latter emphasis gives rise to the term ‘commodification,’ with more and more facets of social life
            converted into marketable opportunities for extraction. Our use of the term ‘commodity’ is more like Sraffa
            (1960) in his book <em>Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities</em>. There, commodities are all
            produced outputs. They are produced for a market, but they are not exchanged for money. This gives space for
            our proposition that commodities can be produced for the commons (without a price). Similarly, there can be
            no suggestion that our use of the term commodity is subject to a ‘fetishism’ of commodities, developed by
            Marx (1867) at the end Chapter&nbsp;1 of Volume I of <em>Capital</em>, for this term, too, is
            capitalist-specific. In many analyses, the political response to fetishism is to take goods and services out
            of market relations. Our proposal is to change the nature of markets.

            actions. We know that these standard metrics, conventions and rules have been constantly evolving since

            the era. Activities outside profit criteria are interpreted through the discourse of subsidies (and taxes),
